# UCONN_CLAS
This project uses clustering and machine learning to analyze a dataset and predict a poorly described outcome variable  𝑦 . PCA reduces dimensionality, K-means clusters data into 3-4 groups, and Random Forest predicts  𝑦 ^.  The goal is to uncover patterns, improve predictions, and derive actionable insights
