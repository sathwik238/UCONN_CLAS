they are looking for insights from a data source with 40 records


Data comes from college and is completely masked and is confidential



y is the outcome variavle and is poorly described(can be ignored)

covariates:
X1, X2, X3 measure similar things
Z1, Z2 measure similar thigns
A measure one aspect
B measure an aspect(not same as A)

we can ignore rows where y==0, but its experimental,

we need to cluster ther data into 3 or 4 grouos and the relate them to the Y.

and create a function to predict y_hay, to better predict y(because currently y is poorly described)
